# Reconstruct Original Shape

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Vikas-ABD/Reconstruct_original_shape.git
cd Reconstruct_original_shape
```

### 2. Run the Notebook
- Open **`Reconstruct_Original_Shape.ipynb`** in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
- Execute the cells step by step to analyze and reconstruct the original shape.

## Problem Statement

### **Problem Statement 2**
A machine component experienced multiple deformations following extended usage. A sensor was used to digitally reconstruct the componentâ€™s shape, representing it as a **collection of points** that define its surface. These points are stored in the file **`3d_shape_points_data.npz`**.

### **Your Task**
1. **Determine the original shape of the object.**
2. **Identify the deformations present in the component.**
3. **Reconstruct the original shape by correcting the deformations.**

By following the steps in the notebook, you will process the point cloud data and apply shape reconstruction techniques to restore the original structure of the component.
